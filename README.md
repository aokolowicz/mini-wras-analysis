# MINI-WRAS Analysis

This repository contains a Python script named `number_concentration_filewise.py`, which is designed to analyze and visualize number concentration data obtained from GRIMM MINI-WRAS 1.371 (Wide-Range Aerosol Spectrometer). The script processes data from the `sample-data` folder, specifically the `one_day_sample-C.dat` file, to compute and visualize number concentration trends.\
**Feel free to use and customize it to analyze your own data!**

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have Python installed on your machine. Additionally, install the required libraries by running:

```bash
pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn
```

## Usage

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/aokolowicz/mini-wras-analysis.git
```

2. Navigate to the repository folder:

```bash
cd mini-wras-analysis
```

3. Run the script:

```bash
python number_concentration_filewise.py
```

choosing the right keyword and file extension in `list_files()` function or change the `path` variable in `helpers.py`.

```bash
files = list_files(dir_tree, "location", ".dat")
```

4. Other scripts require merged data. Make sure to use the following script beforehand.

```bash
python merge-mini-wras-data.py
```

5. You will be prompted regarding saving the generated figures.
